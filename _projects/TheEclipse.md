# The Eclipse

### Devlog 1: Foundations and First Steps
The journey started with establishing the game's fundamental mechanics. A core focus was on character movement and developing parkour like traversal. Vaulting and climbing were implemented based on the height of obstacles, allowing the character to interact dynamically with the environment. This early system brought a strong sense of mobility and responsiveness to the player controls.

### Devlog 2: Cinematics and Worldbuilding
With the gameplay systems coming together, the next step was to make the world feel alive and cinematic. A custom spline camera events framework was developed, allowing designers to trigger in-game events tied to a dolly cam system. This allowed smooth, controlled transitions between gameplay and fixed cinematic angles—perfect for cutscenes, reveals, or dramatic moments. The camera could now seamlessly shift perspective for storytelling or to highlight key gameplay events.

Alongside that, the basic gameplay infrastructure such as AI movement and navmesh systems—was built, enabling intelligent navigation for enemies and NPCs. UI development also kicked off during this phase, with menu panels and buttons setting the stage for in-game interactions like pausing and starting the game. These initial systems laid the groundwork for everything that followed.

New animation overrides were added for characters like thugs and a frog enemy, giving them distinct movement styles and expressions. Power-up collectables were also introduced, adding another layer of interactivity and reward. Small changes like disabling fixed cameras by default helped streamline the experience, ensuring a fluid and immersive world.

### Devlog 3: Final Polish and Game Feel
As the project neared completion, attention turned to refining the feel and flow of gameplay. Bug fixes were tackled—such as ensuring the player's health bar updated correctly—and final tweaks were made to animations, navigation, and interactions.

Navigation meshes were updated for smoother movement, ensuring both the player and AI could traverse the environment as intended. With the core systems in place and final touches applied, the game reached a more polished and complete state.

### Gameplay Overview
The final experience brings together responsive parkour movement, immersive enemy behavior, cinematic camera moments, and satisfying collectable feedback. Players can vault and climb over environmental obstacles with fluid motion, while dynamic cameras highlight key moments in gameplay. A clean UI and functional menu system ensure that the user experience is smooth from start to finish.

With everything tied together from systems to polish the result is a game that balances action, exploration, and cinematic storytelling.
