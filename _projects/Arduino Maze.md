# Dynamic Arduino Maze

The task in hand was to create a dynamically generated maze on a dot matrix display, controlled using an Arduino and an accelerometer sensor!

Working on this project was an incredible learning experience, filled with both challenges and triumphs. One of the most memorable hurdles was dealing with a display matrix where one of the modules was inverted. This meant I had to dig deep into my coding skills to develop a workaround, ensuring the maze displayed correctly. It was a fantastic exercise in problem-solving and adaptability, and it taught me the importance of flexibility in coding.

The core of the project involved using the accelerometer to control the movement within the maze, making it an interactive and engaging experience. Seeing the maze dynamically change and respond to the sensor input was incredibly rewarding and a testament to the power of combining hardware and software in innovative ways.

Looking back, I’m proud of how this project turned out and the skills I developed along the way. It’s projects like these that fuel my passion for technology and continuous learning.
