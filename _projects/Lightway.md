# Lightway

I had an incredible time participating in this intense 48-hour challenge, where the theme was fittingly "Light and Wonder." My creation for this event is a third-person adventure game named LIGHTWAY, and I'm thrilled to introduce it to you all!

ðŸŒŸ Game Concept:
The game unfolds in a semi-dark, mystical world where glowing orbs, representing lost souls, are scattered. The player's mission is to collect these orbs to unlock enchanted ruins and progress through the game. Each of the three levels presents a unique challenge:

1. Collecting the Lost Souls: Players must gather all the glowing orbs within each level.
2. Unlocking the Ruins: Deliver the orbs to the ruins to break the enchanted seals.
3. Gaining New Mechanics: With each seal broken, the player is granted new abilities such as running, jumping, and more!

The gameâ€™s environment is designed to highlight the ethereal glow of the orbs, creating a visually striking contrast that enhances the overall experience.

ðŸ‘¾ Achievements:
- Completed a fully functional game within 48 hours.
- Designed three immersive levels, each with its unique set of challenges.
- Successfully implemented new mechanics as rewards for progression.

Participating in the Light & Wonder Game Jam was an exhilarating and rewarding experience, pushing the boundaries of creativity and technical skills under tight deadlines. I'm proud of what I've accomplished and grateful for the opportunity.
