## Project
Worked on implementation of new features and optimizing the overall system services. Provided stable OS builds for several devices with long lasting updates of security patches and bug fixes.

## OTA Updates Service
I led the development of a robust and dynamic website utilizing PHP, JavaScript, and Flask API services. My primary focus was on backend development, where I effectively managed API calls to the Flask server to retrieve and present data dynamically. This ensured seamless integration and real-time info to provide updates for multiple versions and devices. Additionally, I implemented strategies to optimize server load, thereby minimizing downtimes and enhancing the websiteâ€™s reliability and user experience. This project demonstrated my ability to integrate diverse technologies and manage complex data interactions while maintaining high performance and availability.
